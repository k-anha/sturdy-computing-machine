<br>  Dear Diary,
Aaj ka din kaafi ajeeb tha, well ajeeb kahna ajjeb hoga but it was differernt in a way from my rest of the days, but still it is same in many ways. I wouldn't waste my time telling you that all stuff because i also don't have any idea of what is going on with my life. It seems to me that i hit a bottleneck {means. reached at its limit}.

<br> 
<br>
Was something special happened? I don't know. To tell you truth i don't have any idea what is going on with my life. Sometimes i want to just live, {Is this what i want?}. Actually, I am not even sure of what is the purpose of my life.

<br>
<br>
Then why are you living you ask? It is simply because I don't want peoples around me to loose hope whether it's in me or themselves. That is the purpose i am following till now and that is the reason why i am here till this day of my life. 

<br>
<br>
But you know when it hurts most? It's simply when i have to enjoy my life I can't do. It's not like I am denying on carrying family responsibilities, It's just that i want to have a normal life.

<br>
<br>
You are right, I am still confused, I don't think I want a normal life. Let's just be honest with you. <b><i> What i want </b></i> is pretty simple. I want a peaceful time with my precious ones, even if i have little money and have nothing. Still I will be happy. Then the only pain that i will feel will be pain of separation. Getting separated from our loved ones is one of the most painful things one could ever accept, even if it is lord. He will have to bear this pain of separation. I wish i can tell you how much is my Heart aching just form thinking about it.

<br> <br>
Let's change this topic. Sometimes talking about it makes me cry a lot, and i don't know if i have right to cry.

<br><br> 
Let's forget about this. So, what are you saying. "My hobby?". Actually I don't have particular hobby and as for what i like is pretty simple and that is just to not get bore. Yes you heard it right. It's not like that i am a work maniac. Nope, I am opposite, I hate to do work. I just don't like gettibg bore.

<br> <br>
And as for how i spend my free time? I just sleep or chat with my family or study or learn something and finally i listen to songs that i like.
<br> <br>

Dear Diary,

<br>

Hello, It's 13:20 right now and I am super hungry. You know what I am starving but I cannot eat right now because there are some peoples here doing some work and i have to give them my attention so that they do not slack off, and I am doing it. Even if I have a lot of works to do  am still here being a guard and telling you about it. How courageous you see I am. 

<br>
It's ok let me tell you about my dream of this morning. Actually I remember it very vaguely though. But I still have many contents to share. One of them is that in this Institute's reception desk where I was sitiing a snake appeared. I was at least 3 meters long, with green scales and was staring at me while hissing its tounge out. It kinda looked venomous enough to put me in hospital for at least 1 month. 
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;">It's 06:41 pm</div>
<br>
Actually Shubham Bhaiya called for me or maybe Sudha Didi. I don't know. You see this I don't have a memory of what happened with me in this afternoon. I don't know but it seems to me that i am loosing a bit of my memory, I don't know if I am right or wrong but one thing for sure and that is I am getting disturbed so I am getting into an adult phase and poor me. I don not have anyone to share this except you. So first of all Thank You for being so much to me. Let's et on the topic so I was aying that I am starting to forget incidents. I have a trick that can allow one person to loose it's memory and that can be solved by taking a bath. Yes you read it right. Simply taking a bath can ensure that you will forget. Let's see how.
<br><br>
<div style="text-align: start; font-family: 'Courier', Times, serif; font-size: medium; font-weight: bolder;">Let's See</div>
<br>
You know this that our brain is a a type of muscle that stores data and uses electricity i.e. neurons to store them. In some points I can be wrong. But by bathing with cold water with at least temperature of 15 degree celcius, it will freeze our brain and will slow down its functionality in compare to it's usual speed. So, what I am basically saying is that it is mainly used by Yogis in India.

  Dear Diary,

  <br>
  Hello again, How are you..........
  <br>
  Today was good than the rest of the days, I am a bit happy. Actually I got my salary and that is that made me a bit good. It's fine.
  <br>
  So, what I am currentlty doing? Actually I have headphones on and am listening songs on youtube its on autoplay and romantic songs keep coming. I am hungry.मुझे भी लग रहा है| So hungry yaar.
  Do you anything for me to eat. Anything that is edible for me will do just make sure its good. Well what do you like to eat by the way?
  <br>
  And also I am getting bore. Yes a lot of boring days are these days. And on top of that I do not like winters.
  You know what i just noticed a funny thing and that is I am doing Diary Entry in code editor.
  This is something very funny for me because code editor keeps shoing me abbrevations and accidently I keep on clicking them. In short I am triggering codes while making entry.
  Funny huh!!!

Hello dear, What's up?

<br>
Today I am getting a lot of hiccups, and i don't know why. It's irritating maybe someone is remembering me and now I am getting this again. Maybe I didn't ate something? No I did ate a lot. Well not that much but still it as enough. Now I am getting hungry again. I feel like to eat something good that gurantees that my stomach wil be full.

  Hello It's morning time currentlty 10:39 am. I don't know why but form last two days I feel weird. You can say weird in a paranormal way? Maybe or maybe it's just because I am lacking Vitamin D. I don't know, but one thing for sure and that is it's not a good sign and I am missing someone a lot but can't make a move to approcach it. Poor me. I am not even feeling to work. Just want to meet it and just want see if it's ok. How can I do this? Oh God. Help me. What should I do? I am not sure.
  Maybe I should call it or maybe not. Forget it. Leave it on Baba and he will take care of it. Just take this load off your head and trust me. Hello again Dear Diary. How are you? I am fine almost. 
  What I am doing here? Well it's simple I don't have mood to do work so I am just using you as an excuse to ............................................................. taking a break from my work. How is it?

Hello Dear, Today what I am going to tell you might seem a bit weird, but that is the absolute truth that I have known and maybe I am wrong but still this feels true so I am going to tell you.
<br>
The secret is that there is nothing. Yes there is nothing out there also there is nothing inside. There is no you no me no we, no today, no yesterday also no tomorrow. Then what is it that we see? we feel? and talk to? Your Question is right, but I think you know this. That is you. Yes, you are nothing nad you are everything. Youa re the one who made this world and set it for yourself. You are every person alive, dead. You are past, present and future. You are the one who created me, you are the reason I am here and you will be the reason I will be destroyed. But will I really be destroyed. No, since I am everywhere. Since there was no me from the start I cannot be destroyed but I can just change my name, my body and again I will be someone else. 
<br>
Now the question is for whom am I really trying to do all sort of things. For myself? I guess not, because I do not want anything. I am nothing but everything. 
<br>
Who am I?
